```{r}
here::i_am("eval-grades1.Rproj")
library(here)
library(vroom)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Question 1 data import
```{r}
data <- vroom(here("grades.csv"))
```
## Question 2
Give the number of grades in the data set directly in the text of your quarto file, in a sentence of the form “The data set contains xxx grades.” where xxx is replaced by the number of grades. This must be computed from the data set.
```{r}
data %>% distinct(grade)
nrow(data)
```
In total, we have 64995 grades but only 214 dinstincts
